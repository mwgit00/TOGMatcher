# TOGMatcher

This is a project for doing experiments with OpenCV template matching using X and Y gradient images as the templates.

# Installation

The project compiles in the Community edition of Visual Studio 2015 (VS 2015).  It uses the Windows pre-built OpenCV 4.0.1 libraries extracted to **c:\opencv-4.0.1**.  I just copied the appropriate OpenCV DLLs to wherever I had my executables.  It creates a command-line Windows executable.  I have tested it on a Windows 7 64-bit machine with Service Pack 1.

## Camera

I tested with a Logitech c270.  It was the cheapest one I could find that I could purchase locally.  It was plug-and-play.
